# Hey there, I’m Ashutosh! 👋

I’m a **DevOps Engineer** from Kathmandu, Nepal, who’s all about making systems smarter, faster, and just plain cooler. I love tinkering with Kubernetes, wrestling CI/CD pipelines into submission, and lately, poking around in blockchain stuff with Bittensor. If it involves automation or cloud magic, I’m probably obsessed with it.

## What I’m Up To These Days 🚀
- **Kubernetes Shenanigans**: I’m building custom operators with **KubeBuilder** and **Golang** to tame multi-user clusters—think of it like herding cats, but with code. It’s already sped things up by 25% at work!  
- **Blockchain Adventures**: Playing with **Bittensor** and Python to figure out how decentralized tech can shake up infrastructure. It’s wild and I’m hooked.  
- **Cloud Life**: I’m always deploying something with **Docker**, **Helm**, and **Terraform**, usually powered by **GitHub Actions** or **Jenkins**. Keeps me on my toes!

## My Toolbox 🛠️
- **Coding**: Python (my go-to), Golang (for the fancy stuff), Node.js, Bash  
- **Cloud Vibes**: AWS (EC2, ECS, Lambda, Cloudwatch), Azure  
- **Container Chaos**: Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, KubeBuilder  
- **IaC Magic**: Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation  
- **CI/CD Hustle**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Bitbucket CI  
- **Keeping Watch**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Zabbix  
- **Security Stuff**: Snyk (SAST), ZAP (DAST)  
- **Extras**: Git, Linux, GitOps, Bittensor

## Where I’ve Been 💼
- **Jr. DevOps Engineer @ Berrybytes** (Jun 2024 – Now)  
  I’m the guy keeping Kubernetes in check, automating deployments, and making sure everything’s up 99.9% of the time. It’s a blast!  
- **DevOps Intern @ Leapfrog Technology** (Feb 2024 – Apr 2024)  
  Slashed deployment times by 30% with some slick CI/CD pipelines on AWS and Azure. Felt like a superhero.  
- **Project Intern @ National Innovation Center** (Mar 2022 – Jun 2022)  
  Helped build medical drone simulations—yep, drones! It was as cool as it sounds.

## Stuff I’ve Built 🌟
- **[Automated AWS Deployment](https://github.com/AshutoshBrl)**  
  Threw a Dockerized app onto AWS EC2 with Terraform and GitHub Actions. It’s alive!  
- **[Over Speed Detection & Number Plate Recognition](https://github.com/AshutoshBrl)**  
  Cooked up a Python project with CNNs to catch speedy cars and read their plates. Felt like a tech detective.  
- **[3-Tier CRUD App](https://github.com/AshutoshBrl)**  
  Whipped up a quick Node.js and PostgreSQL app. Simple, but taught me a ton.

## School & Badges 🎓
- **B.E. in Electronics and Communication** – Kathmandu Engineering College (2017–2022)  
  Where I first got hooked on tech.  
- **Certifications**: AWS Essential Workshop (2021), Linux Essentials (Cisco, 2022), Python Intermediate (Cisco, 2023)
